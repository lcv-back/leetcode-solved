return -1 if otherwise

stragetry
- the team can be divide: numTeams = skill.size() / 2
- the sum such that each team need to adding: sumOfEachSubArr = totalSum / numTeams
	if can not divide: totalSum % numTeams != 0 return -1

- Have vector<vector<int>> store to storage the any subarray
- Find the index can be replace insite the array
