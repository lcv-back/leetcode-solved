# Understand requirements
- Give a vector strings 
- Return strings is substring of another string

# Solution 1: Brute Force
  1. Prepare
  - Initialize the vector ans storage elements valid
  - Initialize set storage elements was visited
  2. Process
  - Traversal from 0 to words size => [i]
  	- Get current string => words[i]
  - Traversal from 0 to words size => [j]
  	- Satisfy condition: 
  		+ string at j differene string at i => words[i] != words[j] => j != i
  		+ check string have sub string is another string? => true
  		+ set don't storage j
  	- If satisfy all conditions:
  		+ Insert j to set
  		+ Insert words[j] to vector ans

  3. Output
  - Return the vector ans
