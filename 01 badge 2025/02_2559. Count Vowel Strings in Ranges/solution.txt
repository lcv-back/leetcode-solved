understand the requirements:
	input:
		- words: vector of string
		- queries: vector of query (from start to end) and query on words
	process:
		- operations with queries size
		- each operation:
			with each vector on queries vector
				queries[i] = [left[i], right[i]]
					with left[i] and right[i] representation for the begin element and the end element on words vector
						- impotant: check the first and the last string is vowel character?
							- if true counting plus 1
	output:
		- the vector size same the vector queries size
		- the vector storage elements are the number valid after any operations

solution 1: brute force
	- initialize the vector result same size like queries vector
	- iterate: queries vector: 0 -> queries size
		with queries[i] = left[i], right[i]
		iterate on words vector: i = left[i] and i <= right[i] (0 <= i <= words size)
			check the words[i]:
				the first element and the last element are vowel character => update result on i position
	- return result vector
