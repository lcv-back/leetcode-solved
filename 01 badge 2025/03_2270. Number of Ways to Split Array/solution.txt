solution 1: brute force
	1. prepare
		- initialize the left represent for first part and the right represent for second part
		- 0 signed the left
		- calculate the sum of vector -> right
	2. process
		- iterate from 0 to size-1 (because the second part at least one elements)
		- each element perform operations:
			- left plus with element
			- right minus with element
		- check:
			- if left greater than or equal to right => res plus 1
	3. return res
